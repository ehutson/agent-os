## Core Principles

### Constants Over Magic Numbers

- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

### Meaningful Names

- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

### Smart Comments

- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

### Single Responsibility

- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth
- Extract repeated business logic to private methods
- Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components
- Create utility functions for common operations

### Clean Structure

- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

### Encapsulation

- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

### Testing

- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Version Control

- Write clear commit messages
- Use meaningful branch names

### Keep It Simple

- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones

### Optimize for Readability
- Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for "why" not "what"

## Dependencies

### Choose Libraries Wisely
When adding third-party dependencies:
- Select the most popular and actively maintained option
- Check the library's GitHub repository for:
  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)
  - Active issue resolution
  - Number of stars/downloads
  - Clear documentation
