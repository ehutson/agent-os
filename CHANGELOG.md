# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent OS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **Claude Code Specialized Subagents** - New agents to offload specific tasks for improved efficiency:
  - `test-runner.md` - Handles test execution and failure analysis with minimal toolset
  - `context-fetcher.md` - Retrieves information from files while checking context to avoid duplication
  - `git-workflow.md` - Manages git operations, branches, commits, and PR creation
  - `file-creator.md` - Creates files, directories, and applies consistent templates
- **Agent Detection Pattern** - Single check at process start with boolean flags for efficiency
- **Subagent Integration** across all instruction files with automatic fallback for non-Claude Code users

### Changed
- **Instruction Files** - All updated to support conditional agent usage:
  - `execute-tasks.md` - Uses git-workflow (branch management, PR creation), test-runner (full suite), and context-fetcher (loading lite files)
  - `execute-task.md` - Uses context-fetcher (best practices, code style) and test-runner (task-specific tests)
  - `plan-product.md` - Uses file-creator (directory creation) and context-fetcher (tech stack defaults)
  - `create-spec.md` - Uses file-creator (spec folder) and context-fetcher (mission/roadmap checks)
- **Standards Files** - Updated for conditional agent usage:
  - `code-style.md` - Uses context-fetcher for loading language-specific style guides
- **Setup Scripts** - Enhanced to install Claude Code agents:
  - `setup-claude-code.sh` - Downloads all agents to `~/.claude/agents/` directory

### Improved
- **Context Efficiency** - Specialized agents use minimal context for their specific tasks
- **Code Organization** - Complex operations delegated to focused agents with clear responsibilities
- **Error Handling** - Agents provide targeted error analysis and recovery strategies
- **Maintainability** - Cleaner main agent code with operations abstracted to subagents
- **Performance** - Reduced context checks through one-time agent detection pattern

### Technical Details
- Each agent uses only necessary tools (e.g., test-runner uses only Bash, Read, Grep, Glob)
- Automatic fallback ensures compatibility for users without Claude Code
- Consistent `IF has_[agent_name]:` pattern reduces code complexity
- All agents follow Agent OS conventions (branch naming, commit messages, file templates)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- New `mission-lite.md` file generation in product initialization for efficient AI context usage
- New `spec-lite.md` file generation in spec creation for condensed spec summaries
- New `execute-task.md` instruction file for individual task execution with TDD workflow
- Task execution loop in `execute-tasks.md` that calls `execute-task.md` for each parent task
- Language-specific code style guides:
  - `standards/code-style/css-style.md` for CSS and TailwindCSS
  - `standards/code-style/html-style.md` for HTML markup
  - `standards/code-style/javascript-style.md` for JavaScript
- Conditional loading blocks in `best-practices.md` and `code-style.md` to prevent duplicate context loading
- Context-aware file loading throughout all instruction files

### Changed
- Optimized `plan-product.md` to generate condensed versions of documents
- Enhanced `create-spec.md` with conditional context loading for mission-lite and tech-stack files
- Simplified technical specification structure by removing multiple approach options
- Made external dependencies section conditional in technical specifications
- Updated `execute-tasks.md` to use minimal context loading strategy
- Improved `execute-task.md` with selective reading of relevant documentation sections
- Modified roadmap progress check to be conditional and context-aware
- Updated decision documentation to avoid loading decisions.md and use conditional checks
- Restructured task execution to follow typical TDD pattern (tests first, implementation, verification)

### Improved
- Context efficiency by 60-80% through conditional loading and lite file versions
- Reduced duplication when files are referenced multiple times in a workflow
- Clearer separation between task-specific and full test suite execution
- More intelligent file loading that checks current context before reading
- Better organization of code style rules with language-specific files

### Fixed
- Duplicate content loading when instruction files are called in loops
- Unnecessary loading of full documentation files when condensed versions suffice
- Redundant test suite runs between individual task execution and overall workflow
